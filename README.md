                             Problem Statement
                            -------------------

Many libraries face challenges in efficiently tracking and managing their book inventory, 
leading to issues such as difficulty in locating books, inefficient loan processes, 
and lack of real-time updates on book availability. 
There is a need for a comprehensive Library Management System that can streamline book tracking, 
improve user experience by facilitating easy book searches and reservations,
and enhance the overall management of library operations.
Allow me to present to you my a Library Database Management System designed to facilitate the management of library resources.
It includes functionalities for tracking books, members, and lending operations. It consists of tables for MEMBERS, BOOKS, and LOANS, which facilitate the tracking of library members, the books they can borrow, and the loans associated with each member. The functionality includes allowing members to borrow books, insert new records for both members and books, and enforce data integrity through transactions, ensuring that changes are committed only if all operations succeed. Access control is implemented through user roles, restricting certain operations based on user permissions. Overall, this database supports effective management and organization of library resources and member activities.
